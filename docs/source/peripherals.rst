===========
MetaWear boards come with several auxiliary features that developers can use to provide feedback to their users such as starting a vibration motion 
when 10,000 steps are taken or turning on the LED if the temperature is outside of a desireable range.  Developers can also enhance the functionality 
of the boards by using the GPIO pins to add additional sensors or devices.
